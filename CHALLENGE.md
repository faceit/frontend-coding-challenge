Ideas:

- Given a test that validates fetch and render of list elements
  - Implement fetching and rendering list of components
  - Implement the test: add mock to get request
- Implement deleting mechanism for tournament
- Our players found an issue, there are two tournament created instead of one. Find a reason and fix it.
- Suggest codebase improvements
