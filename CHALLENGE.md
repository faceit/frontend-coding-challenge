# Challenge

## Prerequisites

- Fork this repository `frontend-coding-challenge` privately to your GitHub account.
- Checkout the forked repository and work on a branch named `solution`.

---

## Introduction

You are given a prepared SPA project that was bootstrapped with Create React App.
The app must render a list of tournaments from a fake REST API (bundled alongside the project).
New tournaments can be created and tournaments should be searchable, editable and removable through the fake REST API.
A few basic elements such as headings, button and input have already been created for you.

## Summary

- The app must render a list of tournaments
- Tournaments must be:
  - Searchable
  - Editable
  - Deletable
- Search functionality must be optimised with performance in mind

### Notes

- Redux _must_ be used for data fetching
- Alternatively to `styled-components`, you may use [CSS/CSS Modules/Sass provided by CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-stylesheet)
- Any _open-source_ library is allowed to be used
- You can restart the application to reset/regenerate the data
- There is a provided theme which you are free to use
